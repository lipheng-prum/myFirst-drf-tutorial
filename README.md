🧠 My First Django REST Framework Project

This project represents my journey of learning and understanding how to build RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).
Through this tutorial project, I explored how to connect Django models, serializers, and views to expose clean, efficient, and secure API endpoints.

🎯 What I Learned
🧩 1. Django REST Framework Fundamentals

How to install and configure Django REST Framework inside a Django project.

The difference between APIView, Generic Views, and ViewSets.

How to return structured JSON responses from Django.

How to use serializers to convert models into JSON and validate data.

🗂️ 2. Building CRUD APIs

Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for multiple apps (API, Blog, Employees).

Learned how to define URL routes and connect them to views.

Explored pagination, filtering, and querysets in DRF.

🧠 3. Django App Architecture

Created modular apps like:

api – for general API testing and pagination

blog – for managing blog posts

employees – for storing employee records with filtering features

Learned how Django separates concerns between apps, models, and URLs.

🛠️ 4. Database and ORM

Learned how to create models and run migrations using Django ORM.

Used SQLite3 as the default database to test API endpoints.

Explored how model fields translate into API data.

🔐 5. Good Development Practices

Organized project files following Django conventions.

Used .gitignore to keep the repository clean.

Created reusable code with serializers and pagination classes.

Practiced using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

🧪 What I Can Do Now

After completing this project, I am confident in:
✅ Setting up a Django project from scratch
✅ Designing models and serializers
✅ Building RESTful APIs with CRUD operations
✅ Connecting backend APIs with frontend or IoT devices
✅ Structuring scalable Django projects
